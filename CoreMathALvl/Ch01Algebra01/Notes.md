# Algebra 1

## Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions

* multiplication sign usually ommited

  * $2q$ means $2 \times q$
  * $x \times y$ simplified to $xy$

* when string of numbers and letters are multiplied, multiplication can be done in any order

  * $2p \times 3q = 2 \times p \times 3 \times q$
    $=6pq$

* powers can be used to simplify expressions

  * $x \times x = x^2$
  * $x \times x^2 = x \times x \times x = x^3$

* power refers only to number or letter it is written above

  * $2x^2$ means $x$ is squared but 2 is not

### Example 1a
1. $(4pq)^2 \times 5 = 4pq \times 4pq \times 5 = 80p^2q^2$

2. $\dfrac{ax^2}{x} \div \dfrac{x}{ay^2} = \dfrac{ax \bcancel{^2} }{ \bcancel{y} } \times \dfrac{ay \bcancel{^2}}{ \bcancel{x} } = a^2xy$

## Addition and Subtraction of Expressions

* _terms_ in an algebraic expressions are parts sparated by plus or minus sign
* _Like terms_ contain the same combination of letters
* _Like terms_ can be added or subtracted

  * $2ab + 5ab = 7ab$

* _Unlike terms_ contain different algebraic expressions, they cannot be added or subtracted.
